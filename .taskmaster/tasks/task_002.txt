# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the design system components and tokens based on the style guide and design requirements.
# Details:
1. Set up design tokens in Tailwind config:
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: { /* colors from style guide */ },
        ink: { /* colors from style guide */ },
        sand: { /* colors from style guide */ }
      },
      spacing: {
        // 8-pt grid system
      },
      borderRadius: {
        // radii from style guide
      }
    }
  }
}
```
2. Configure typography with Inter font:
```typescript
// app/fonts.ts
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```
3. Create base components using shadcn and CVA:
   - Button component with variants
   - Card component
   - Section component
   - Navbar component with mobile menu
   - Footer component
4. Implement responsive design utilities

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a component storybook or test page to visually verify all components
2. Test components for responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
3. Verify accessibility of components using axe or similar tools
4. Unit test component variants and states

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Tailwind Design Tokens [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the design tokens in Tailwind configuration based on the style guide, including colors, spacing, and border radius values.
### Details:
Create a complete tailwind.config.js file with all design tokens properly defined. Include the brand, ink, and sand color palettes with specific hex values. Implement an 8-pt spacing grid system (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.). Define border radius tokens (sm, md, lg, xl, etc.) according to the style guide. Also configure any additional design tokens like shadows, transitions, and z-indices.

## 2. Set Up Typography System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure typography with the Inter font and establish text styles for headings, body text, and other text elements.
### Details:
Complete the fonts.ts configuration for Inter font. Create typography classes in Tailwind for different text styles (headings h1-h6, body, caption, etc.) with appropriate font sizes, line heights, and font weights. Implement responsive typography that scales appropriately across different viewport sizes. Add any special text treatments like links, emphasized text, or quotes.

## 4. Build Navigation Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create the Navbar and Footer components with responsive behavior and mobile menu functionality.
### Details:
Implement Navbar component with logo, navigation links, and mobile menu toggle. Create mobile menu with smooth animations for opening/closing. Build Footer component with site links, social media icons, and copyright information. Both components should be responsive and adapt to different viewport sizes. Use the previously created Button component for any CTAs in these components.

## 5. Create Responsive Layout Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement responsive design utilities and layout components to ensure consistent spacing and alignment across the site.
### Details:
Create Container component for consistent max-width and padding across the site. Implement Grid and Flex layout components/utilities for common layout patterns. Add responsive spacing utilities that follow the 8-pt grid system. Create responsive visibility utilities (show/hide at different breakpoints). Document all utilities with examples for the development team.
