Title: Figma → Code Refactor Plan (P&D Website)

Overview
- Goal: Align the Next.js UI with the Figma file "P&D Website" (file key sPBMeqfFSTCQEQwu6IHUOz)
- Scope sources: Frames — Landing Page, Our Services, About Us, Contact Us; Components frame; design tokens
- Success: Visual parity at desktop/tablet/mobile; a11y ≥ 95; perf/SEO green

Constraints & Tech
- Next.js App Router, React 18, Tailwind 3, CVA, Radix Slot
- Prefer RSC; minimal client components
- Assets via next/image; explicit dimensions; focus-visible

Design Tokens to Sync
- Colors from Figma styles → Tailwind theme (brand/ink/sand)
- Typography from Figma → next/font + Tailwind font sizes/line heights
- Spacing/radii/shadows from Figma → Tailwind theme extensions

Core UI Primitives to Align (CVA)
- Button: variants (primary/secondary/ghost), sizes (sm/md/lg), states (hover/focus/disabled)
- Card: variants (elevated/outline/flat), padding options
- Section: container widths, backgrounds (brand/ink/sand), spacing presets
- Input/Textarea: valid/error states, sizes, helper text

Per-Page Requirements (by Frame)
1) Landing Page
  - Sections: Nav Bar, Hero, Section 2, Section 3, Section 4, Footer
  - Responsive: map Figma layout to sm/md/lg/xl; spacing matches tokens
  - Assets: export hero and section images from Figma
  - A11y: headings order, landmark roles, contrast
  - SEO: metadata and OG image

2) Our Services
  - Sections: Nav Bar, Section 1–4, Footer
  - Service cards: align to component specs; consistent CTAs
  - A11y + SEO as above

3) About Us
  - Sections: Nav Bar, Section 1–4, Footer
  - Team cards; content structure
  - JSON-LD Organization

4) Contact Us
  - Sections: Nav Bar, Section 1–3, Footer
  - Form aligns to primitives; validation/error states visual parity
  - Success/error flows

Verification
- Lighthouse a11y/perf/SEO checks via BrowserTools MCP
- Visual side-by-side check to Figma per page

Out of Scope (Now)
- Animations beyond simple fades
- New features not present in Figma

Risks
- Token drift; asset mismatch; responsive edge cases

Deliverables
- Updated Tailwind config, CVA components, pages with parity
