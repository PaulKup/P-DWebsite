      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Design Tokens in Tailwind",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Configure Design Tokens in Tailwind' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Extract color tokens from Figma, 2) Extract typography and spacing tokens from Figma, 3) Configure tailwind.config.js with extracted tokens, and 4) Create a design token test page for verification.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves extracting design tokens from Figma and implementing them in Tailwind, requiring understanding of both systems. The complexity comes from ensuring accurate extraction and proper implementation in the configuration file. Four subtasks would effectively separate the extraction of different token types, configuration, and verification."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Core UI Button Component",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Core UI Button Component' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Implement base Button component with CVA variants, 2) Add accessibility features and keyboard interactions, and 3) Create a test page with all button variants and states.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a button component with CVA requires moderate complexity due to the need to handle multiple variants, states, and accessibility concerns. The implementation is well-defined in the details, but requires careful attention to accessibility and testing across all variants."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core UI Card Component",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Core UI Card Component' task into 2 subtasks: 1) Implement the Card component with all variants and padding options, and 2) Create a test page demonstrating all card variants with proper content nesting.",
      "reasoning": "The Card component is simpler than the Button as it has fewer states and accessibility concerns. The implementation is straightforward with CVA for styling variants. Two subtasks are sufficient to cover implementation and testing."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core UI Section Component",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Core UI Section Component' task into 2 subtasks: 1) Implement the Section component with background, spacing, and container variants, and 2) Create a test page demonstrating all section variants and responsive behavior.",
      "reasoning": "The Section component requires handling multiple variants for backgrounds, spacing, and container widths. It's moderately complex due to the need to ensure proper responsive behavior and semantic HTML support. Two subtasks allow focus on implementation and thorough testing."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Core UI Input/Textarea Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Core UI Input/Textarea Components' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Implement base Input component with states and variants, 2) Implement Textarea component with states and variants, 3) Create FormField wrapper component for labels and error messages, and 4) Create a test form with all input types and validation states.",
      "reasoning": "Form components have higher complexity due to multiple states (default, focus, error, disabled), accessibility requirements, and the need for proper validation feedback. Creating both Input and Textarea components plus a FormField wrapper increases the scope, justifying four subtasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Landing Page' task into 5 subtasks: 1) Implement page structure and metadata, 2) Create Hero section with responsive layout, 3) Implement Sections 2-3 with content and components, 4) Implement Section 4 with content and components, and 5) Perform accessibility and responsive testing.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a full landing page involves implementing multiple complex sections with responsive layouts, images, and interactive elements. The page requires proper SEO metadata, semantic HTML structure, and accessibility considerations. Five subtasks allow focus on different page sections and testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Our Services Page' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Implement page structure and metadata, 2) Create header section and service card grid, 3) Implement remaining content sections, and 4) Perform accessibility and responsive testing.",
      "reasoning": "The Services page is moderately complex with a focus on service cards and consistent CTAs. It requires implementing a grid of cards with images and proper responsive behavior. Four subtasks allow separation of the card grid implementation from other page sections and testing."
    },

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement About Us Page' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Implement page structure and metadata with JSON-LD, 2) Create header and company story sections, 3) Implement team member grid with cards, and 4) Perform accessibility and responsive testing.",
      "reasoning": "The About Us page includes team cards, content structure, and JSON-LD structured data. The implementation of the team member grid with proper responsive behavior adds complexity. Four subtasks allow focus on structured data, content sections, team grid, and testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Contact Us Page with Form' task into 5 subtasks: 1) Implement page structure and metadata, 2) Create contact form component with all fields, 3) Implement form validation and error states, 4) Add form submission handling with success/error states, and 5) Perform accessibility and form testing.",
      "reasoning": "The Contact page has high complexity due to the interactive form with validation, error states, and submission handling. Client-side validation and managing form state add significant complexity. Five subtasks allow separation of form implementation, validation logic, submission handling, and testing."
    },

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Shared Components and Verification' task into 5 subtasks: 1) Implement Navbar component with mobile responsiveness, 2) Implement Footer component with all sections, 3) Create verification script for automated testing, 4) Perform cross-page visual verification against Figma designs, and 5) Run and document accessibility and performance audits.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating shared components used across all pages and implementing comprehensive verification. The Navbar has complex responsive behavior with mobile menu states. The verification process requires automated testing scripts and manual checks against designs. Five subtasks effectively separate component implementation from verification steps."
