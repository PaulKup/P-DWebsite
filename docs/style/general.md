- Rules that always apply
  - Implement a snapscroll effect with a little bounce to every page
  - CTA Buttons should always be:
    - a superellipse with a flat top and bottom
    - about 4:1 long horizontally
    - Text
      - Color:`#f5efe8`
      - Font: Roboto Mono, 16 pt
    - Effects:
      - Hover effect on button
      - Focus State: `#ae7b60`
      - Hover State: `#984d37`
      - Slightly enlarge on hover.
      - This is how I want all buttons to behave
